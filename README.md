# Fake News Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model for the detection of fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model will analyze textual data from news articles and classify them as either "real" or "fake." This README file provides an overview of the project, details about the dataset used, and submission information.

## Dataset

### Dataset Description

The project utilizes two datasets:
1. `true.csv`: A dataset containing real news articles.
2. `false.csv`: A dataset containing fake news articles.

Each dataset includes columns for the article title, text, subject, and date.

### Dataset Source

The datasets were obtained from [Dataset Source Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).

Please refer to the dataset source for any licensing or usage restrictions.

## Code and Project Structure

The project code and files are organized as follows:

- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets `true.csv` and `false.csv`.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages and dependencies required for the project.
- `main.py`: The main Python script for executing the project.

## Running the Project
